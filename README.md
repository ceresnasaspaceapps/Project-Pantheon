# Pantheon: Temple of Knowledge

Welcome to Pantheon, an educational platform designed to revolutionize how students learn by integrating gamification and artificial intelligence. Inspired by ancient mythology, Pantheon creates a unique learning experience where each subject is represented by a world ruled by a god symbolizing that field of knowledge.

## Features

* **Interactive Worlds** : Each subject is represented by a world, such as Ceres for biology and Apollo for physics, offering a dynamic and immersive learning environment.
* **Personalized Learning** : Teachers can upload subject material that will be used by the AI chatbot to answer student questions with precision.
* **Gamification** : Students can participate in games and challenges, earning points and advancing through levels as they complete educational tasks.
* **Real-Time Data** : The platform incorporates real-time data, such as weather and plant growth conditions, to enhance the learning experience.

## Current State

Pantheon is currently under development. Some of the features already implemented include:

* **Worlds and Subjects** : Ceres (Biology) and Apollo (Physics) are the primary worlds developed so far.
* **AI Chatbot** : A chatbot that leverages OpenAI API to provide real-time answers based on the subject material uploaded by the teachers.
* **Mobile and Web Application** : Pantheon is designed to be accessed from mobile devices and through a web application.

## Future Implementations

* Expansion of more worlds and subjects.
* Integration of additional APIs and real-time data sources.
* Completion of backend functionalities and final UI/UX designs.
